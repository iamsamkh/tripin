The lake is accessible through two tracks, one from Kundal and the other from Ladu valley. The track from Ladu is comparatively easy to walk and less tiring while the track from Kundal is not only difficult but alarmingly dangerous although it is short and links Kundol and Spin Khwar. Its steepness and dangerous bends needs an experienced trekker and unending physical strength.",

Birds from remote lands flock to this lake in the winter and return to their home countries in the autumn. The water is heavily acidic and with its water, you can wash clothes without any broth. Unlike Uchali lake or Khabeki lake, this lake does not have amenities such as boating or fishing. There are two routes to this lake; one is from Kathwayi to Jahlar (if you come from the side of Sargodha) and the other is from Surakki to Naushera and then to Jahlar from there.",

This lake is an important source of freshwater full of trout. Baha Lake is a mysterious lake in Pakistan.\r\n\r\nThe estimated terrain elevation above sea level is 3,622 meters (11,883 ft). Its direction is from north to south. To reach Baha Lake, a person must take the Karakoram Highway from Islamabad to Gilgit. And then take Gilgit-Chitral road west from Gilgit, and then continue his journey straight towards Chitral. When it comes to Langar, the main road goes toward Shandur, and on the left-hand side to the south direction, Khukush Nallah starts. One cannot take any bike or bicycle as there are bothering trek roads to reach Baha Lake. It takes 2 hours from Langar to reach Baha Lake. \r\n\r\nBaha Lake has a sky blue color. It is the longest natural lake in Gilgit-Baltistan. It is 5 kilometers in length and 750 meters in width. It is not an easy job for a person to complete a trip around the lake. It has a reputation as a dangerous lake, however, it is not so.\r\n\r\nAt night time, it is clearly heard that there comes a sound of a bang from the lake. Visitors get afraid of it but it is a natural phenomenon. Which might be the crash of stones inside the lake or the sound of huge trout living in the lake.",

The total population of the village is 2,160 individuals living within 220 households. This is dominantly a Burushaski-speaking village. However, a sizable population of Wakhi and Domaaki speakers also live in the village. The village was settled down in 1903 during the reign of Mir Nazim Khan. Before this, the barren lands were used as grazing land of the Gulmit village. Some Wakhi households from Gulmit also permanently settled down in Shishkat while the Burushaski and Domaaki people migrated from Central Hunza. The village also has historical significance because this was the battleground between the Wakhi population above Gulmit and the state of Nagar and Hunza.",

From a turn-off just beyond Gulmit, a winding jeep track leads upwards for 3 km, until the ground flattens out and the first houses of the village come into view.\nGhulkin occupies the site of an old glacier-fed lake, which has been silted up by continuous sedimentation. Many of the 140 traditional dwellings that constitute Ghulkin village are arranged in a circular form, facing the one-time shores of the lake, creating a wonderfully communal atmosphere. The central area now supports several dwellings and fields, including a strip of land often used as a cricket pitch",

From Kiwai, a single 7-kilometer-long road runs uphill to Shogran, a tourist resort with numerous hotels; the track continues to climb up to Siri Lake and ends at Paye. From here it is a trek of nine hours to the top of the Makra. Hiking on the Makra is difficult due to snow and the gradient of the mountainsides.",

In 1886, the Goan Portuguese Association (later renamed the Karachi Goan Association) commissioned a little-known architect named Moses So make to design this leisure club.  It quickly became the center of social life for the Goan community (composed of Catholics of Portuguese-Hindu descent) in Karachi.  The Karachi Goan Association (KGA) Hall was the first work of construction that catapulted So make to fame, earning him more projects.  Made in the English Renaissance style, it has a pediment, pilasters, hipped roof dormers, and semicircular window openings.\n\n",

The dome was originally covered with turquoise-blue tiles, traces of which can still be seen.

Mirza Jani Baig, while fighting with Emperor Akbar’s troops under Khan Khanan, wrote to his father payday Baig and his son Abul Fateh who were at Thatta, to construct a fort as a place of refuge, should be abandoned to its fate and they should he be compelled to flee before the enemy. He further desired, under such circumstances, the city of Thatta should be abandoned to its fate and they should take themselves along with the peoples to Kalan Kot.

According to recent scholarship based on a rare series of bronze coins and artifacts found in the region, the caves and their adjacent valley probably comprised a sovereign kingdom in Gandhara which maintained at least partial independence for almost 500 years, from c. 4th century AD to the 9th century AD. For most of its history, it was ruled by White Hun (or Hephthalite) governors or princes.",

The beach is home to a curious rock formation called Bujih Koh — a steep cliff rising from the sand entirely on its own. It’s separated from the cliff wall that stretches along the coast straddling the beach between its rocky embrace and the sea. The entire beach is home to a healthy colony of crabs. Another interesting feature about this beach is that there are some caves on the cliffs. The beach is an entirely different entity at night. On full-moon nights, when the rays strike the surf of the incoming waves, they almost seem to glow. Luckily Pakistan also has bioluminescence at Sapat beach in Balochistan, Pakistan.",
